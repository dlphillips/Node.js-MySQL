# Node.js-MySQL

This is a homework project for the UNC Charlotte Coding Bootcamp. In it, I used Node.js to create, read and update data in a MySQL database named bamazon. 

## Installation

Clone or download this repo to a new folder on your system then run npm install in your terminal window. You will need to have MySQL running on your system. Bamazon.sql is included in this repo for you to easily recreate the database along with some sample data.

## Usage

There are three modules. You can run them as follows:

node bamazonCustomer

node bamazonManager

node bamazonSupervisor

Each module offers options that will allow you to manipulate the two tables in the database.
